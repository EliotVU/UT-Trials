# Trials
Trials C++ Plugin for Unreal Tournament. An continuation of my BTimes mutator for UT2004.

# Installing
The plugin is currently a very early work-in-progress, and is thus not yet available as a packaged .pak file.


If you really want to try out this plugin, then you'll have to acquire and compile Unreal Tournament (++UT+Main-CL-3228288) yourself, see: https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealTournament

When is all done and working, proceed by cloning this project and saving it to /UnrealTournament/Plugins/. Compile the project as "Development-Editor", and open STR-Example, and hit play!
